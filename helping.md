Keeping Boston Software Crafters running requires lots of small jobs. If you take on one of these, it's a big help to the organization. You can sign up for one of these and then move to doing something else later on. Or you can suggest a different job that you're interested in doing.

To volunteer or discuss in more detail, [contact us](contact-and-feedback.md).

We really appreciate your help!

Deal with the vendor to get the shirts made.|
| Attendee Greeter|People showing up to an evening event could use a friendly face to greet them. Tell people how to get started. Make them feel welcome.
