Keeping Boston Software Crafters running requires lots of small jobs. If you take on one of these, it's a big help to the organization. You can sign up for one of these and then move to doing something else later on. Or you can suggest a different job that you're interested in doing.

If you want to talk about any of this, find us in [Slack](slack.md) or [contact us](contact.md).

We really appreciate your help!

<!-- ## Considerations -->

<!-- Time: roughly how much effort it will take?

One-time or on-going: how big a commitment are you making?

One person, or shared job: can this task be shared among a few people?

Importance: is it critical that it get done, or is it more casual?

- **Pollster**: Write a survey to find out what people want and what is on their minds. Collect results, summarize for everyone.
- **T-shirt Wizard** It would be amazing to have Boston Software Crafters t-shirts to sell. Find someone to design the shirt (or design it yourself). Work with enough leaders of the group to get approval of the design. Find a vendor with the right price/quality balance. Decide on the right quantity and mix of sizes to order. Deal with the vendor to get the shirts made.
- **Attendee Greeter**  People showing up to an evening event could use a friendly face to greet them. Tell people how to get started. Make them feel welcome. This can be totally informal; if you warmly greet just one apprehensive attendee, you've made a difference!  This is needed both for on line and when we go back to in person.
