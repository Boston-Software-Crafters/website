**Feedback**

We want Boston Software Crafters events to be great for everyone.  We want them to be great for you.

Please let us know how the event was for you. Did you feel welcome? Did you find people to work with or talk with?  What could we do differently?

We really want to hear from you. Be **blunt** if you need to! Honest feedback will help us improve Boston Software Crafters for everyone.

Send an email to any one of us or all of us.

Thanks, we really appreciate it!
