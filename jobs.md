The Boston Software Crafters group is focused on building a community in the Boston area among Software Crafters people.  We welcome job postings of interest to members of the community. Such postings can be sent to our mailing list, posted to our Slack workspace, or both.

In order to ensure that job announcements are relevant and useful to the community and produce good responses, there are four requirements for any job posting:

- The organization must actively support best practices.
- The job must be available to someone living in the Boston area. Either it's in the Boston area, or remote is OK.
- The name of the hiring firm must be clearly provided. No mystery firms hidden behind a hiring agency.

If your job posting meets these simple rules, feel free to s post it to the #jobs channel in [Slack](slack.md).  Messages posted to Slack are subject to after-the-fact moderation.

Some suggestions/requests:

- Don't re-post announcements too often: you will wear out peoples' attention. Six months is a good interval for repeated posts.
- When sending to the mailing list, don't use attachments. Most people won't open them anyway.
- Include an email address for people to respond.
- If you have questions about the format of job postings, take a look at the [previous messages to the list][message-archive].
- Don't post jobs elseware on Boston Software Crafters, for example as event comments.

We don't have a general time during face-to-face events for job announcements. There would be too many to be effective.
