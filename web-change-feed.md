If you want to be informed of changes to the website, you can set this up using tools such as VisualPing.io as described in this [IT world article](https://www.itworld.com/article/2704756/how-to-get-notified-whenever-a-website-changes.html).  The article includes instructions on specifying what type of changes and how to get notified for a specific portion of a page.
