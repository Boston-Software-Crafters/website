It's often said that the best way to learn to write programs is to write programs. This page lists a number of places you can go for ideas about what programs to write to develop your Software Crafters skills. Some sites offer software engineering problems??, which typically are aimed at helping you learn more about the language and how to use it more effectively. Other sites offer challenges that can be solved in any language. These are typically aimed at helping you develop your programming skills and become better at solving problems.

**NOTE**: This is a work-in-progress. The resources listed have only been lightly curated, and there are likely other great ones that should be on this list. We welcome [suggestions](#edit-page).

## Places to ask for help when you're stuck

- The Boston Software Crafters [Slack workspace](https://bostonsoftwarecrafters.com/slack??)
friendly discussion-oriented programming forum.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a good place to find quick answers to specific technical questions, but is usually not a good place for involved discussion about logic or problem-solving.

## Language-agnostic coding challenges

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a Christmas-themed problem set that has offered 25 new programming challenges every December since 2015. Each set is a collection of well-made problems that challenge your ability to reason algorithmically. Problems range from moderate to difficult.

- [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) is a bit of a hodge-podge, offering a well-curated collection of problems introducing concepts in bioinformatics, a small set of introductory Software Crafters problems, and a collection of classical algorithms to implement.

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is great fun for the mathematically-minded. Over 650 problems which ramp up rather quickly in difficulty. If you've got a strong mathematical background you'll have a real advantage here. If not, you might well acquire one.
