## Language-agnostic coding challenges

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a Christmas-themed problem set that has offered 25 new programming challenges every December since 2015. Each set is a collection of well-made problems that challenge your ability to reason algorithmically. Problems range from moderate to difficult.

- [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) is a bit of a hodge-podge, offering a well-curated collection of problems introducing concepts in bioinformatics, a small set of introductory Software Crafters problems, and a collection of classical algorithms to implement.

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is great fun for the mathematically-minded. Over 650 problems which ramp up rather quickly in difficulty. If you've got a strong mathematical background you'll have a real advantage here. If not, you might well acquire one.
