  - [Node.JS](https://github.com/Boston-Software-Crafters/kata-templates/blob/master/nodejs/Readme.md)

- From [Berlin Software Crafters](https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps)Looks through, have not been tried yet by Boston Software Crafter.  **Any volunteer?**

If you want to use an IDE, the above instructions for Visual Studio Code is a good start.  The following JetBrains products are recommended:

- Java: IntelliJ (Community Edition is free)
- Software Crafters : PyCharm (Community Edition is free)
